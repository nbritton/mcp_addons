# Discription:
# This class adds the ability to do virtual machine live migrations between KVM nodes.
# It's main purpose is to provide a highly available cfg01 node using gluster as the
# storage backing for the cfg01 virtual machine disk image. It can be extend to
# support any of the KVM virtual machines with a few simple modifications.

# Installation:
# Save the yaml file to cfg01:/srv/salt/reclass/classes/cluster/*/infra/libvirt_migration.yml
# Additionally, you will need to edit the file to add in your private and public keys for the
# libvirt-qemu account. If you have custom hostnames in your cloud, you may also need to tweak
# the hostnames. After completing these steps then you just have to add the configuration file
# via a class include within ./infra/kvm.yml, then run the linux, openssh, and keepalived state
# on the KVM nodes. Salt will then do all the rest for you.

# Usage:
# By default, this yaml class will enable keepalived to automatically failover the cfg01 virtual
# machine if the KVM node looses connectivity to VRRP multicast group. Additionally, a systemd
# unit file is planned for a feature release that will allow automatic transfer of the cfg01
# node whenever its KVM host is taken offline for service. Furthermore, virtual machines
# can be manually transfered by simply providing the fully qualified virtual machine name
# to the tool. For example:
# /usr/local/bin/gluster-libvirt-live-migrate cfg01.example.com
